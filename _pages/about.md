I am a Ph.D. student majoring in Electronic Information at Zhejiang University, enrolled in 2025, and jointly cultivated by the Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree in Robotic Engineering from the College of Control Science and Engineering in Zhejiang University, while also studying in Chu Kochen Honors College. My research interests include reinforcement learning, legged robot locomotion and navigation, as well as whole-body control.
